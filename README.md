# My studies for Logic and Algorithms

This repository contains my notes and solutions to the exercises from the course "Algorithms and Programming Logic", by Nélio Alves on Udemy. The goal is to solve each problem in different programming languages, deepening the understanding of computational logic and practicing different syntaxes. The exercises cover topics such as sequential structures, conditionals, loops, vectors and matrices, and are organized by topics and languages ​​used.
